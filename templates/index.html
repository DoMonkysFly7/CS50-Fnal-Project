         Born through the pain of tens of thousands of poor cats and kittens, who, due to this world’s cruelty, 
         have never experienced a happy life. For the new ones, the ones that live now or are about to be born into this world: 
         They have no family, we will find one; They have no help, we will help them; They have nobody, we will be there; 
         They experienced no love, we will love them.
