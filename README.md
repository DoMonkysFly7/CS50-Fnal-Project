# Purry Adoption Center - Full Working Website!
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:

I have started the CS50 with my girlfriends' cat (see my Scratch game from Week 0), so I will finish it with it!

I have created a full working website using HTML, CSS, SQLITE3, CSS'S FLEXBOX, CSS'S GRID, PYTHON with FLASK and BOOTSTRAP. This is a learning project, so from start (/index) to finish (/stories), I continuously learned new ways of doing things, I kept improving until it was done just as I imagined it (or...close enough, ha). It was quite fun to make, albeit a bit tedious at times, however, the real work as a Full Stack I expect to be more ore less the same. 

I made this project because I wanted to familiarise myself with such experience, so I understand what to expect in the very near future.

You can enter the website, see all the necessary info regarding the foundation (BASIC INFO, NEWS, DONATION PAGES WITH MULTIPLE DONATION OPTIONS etc.). You can create an account, for which you got certain benefits. You can subscribe to the newsletter.

It is fully responsive (mostly) and works perfectly for any sort of Smartphones. Media Queries and Responsiveness across devices and browsers is definitely something I got to work on in the very near future though.

For every action you take, you will receive an email either thanking you, as in case of donation; confirming what you just did, such as registering and so on and so forth.

For the donation options I took the time to recreate different payment forms, though in real life those would be usually handled by 3rd party services. Everything a user does (such as giving feedback on the /index page) is being recorded in the adoption.db database.

Being a 'learning project', I have improved throught the time it 
took to make it, from start to finish, for about a month, so it could've clearly been done much better, especially in terms of code design. As you could see throughout my Git commits, my last phase was 'code cleaning', of which only purpose it was to make it's design much better. 

Anyway, there you have it! A fully working website which, if you want, you could start using perfectly right now!
